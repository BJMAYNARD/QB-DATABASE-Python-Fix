# QB-DATABASE-Python-Fix
On Going Project to make Desktop QB repair with a click of a button and not go into the Database Manager
Right now - I just have converted the bat file over to a python script. Currently I am working on a "button" to 
make the process a little more seamless for the end user. Right now the bat file uses Task Scheduler to run the file
oon the desktop server version to reset these services.
