# QB-DATABASE-Python-Fix
On Going Project to make Desktop QB repair with a click of a button and not go into the Database Manager
Right now - I have imported a newer version of the bat file that works for stopping and restarting the 3 services for QuickBooks. 

This version is for Desktop Version 2022 Pro.
You will have to add a folder called batch in the root of C: for this to work.
